## Github Classroom Autograde Error Message Formatter
This repository is intended to parse the HTML raw text of the Github Classroom autograde error messages and convert them into a human-readable format, with "Actual" and "Expected" outputs layed out side-by-side.

Simply paste the error message into the file inputFile.txt and run main on AutogradeSplitter.java to see a comparison between actual and expected outputs, with a star in front of each line that has different output.
